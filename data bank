A. Customer Nodes Exploration

How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?

        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT NODE_ID) as node_count FROM data_bank.customer_nodes;


What is the number of nodes per region?


        SELECT region_id, COUNT(DISTINCT NODE_ID) as node_count 
        FROM data_bank.customer_nodes
        GROUP BY region_id;




How many customers are allocated to each region?

        SELECT r.region_name, COUNT(DISTINCT cn.customer_id) as Customer_count 
        FROM data_bank.customer_nodes as cn
        join data_bank.regions as r
        on cn.region_id = r.region_id
        GROUP BY r.region_name;


How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?

        SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date))
        FROM data_bank.customer_nodes;



What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?
        
     with reallocation_days as(
         SELECT *, DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date) as reallocation_days
         FROM data_bank.customer_nodes;)
 percent_cte as(
           select *, percent_rank over (partition by region_id order by reallocation_days)*100 as percentile
           from reallocation_days)
           
   SELECT region_id, percentile, reallocation_days as 95_percentile
   from percent_cte
	where percentile > 95
    group by region_id 
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT region_id, percentile, reallocation_days as 80_percentile
   from percent_cte
	where percentile > 80
    group by region_id
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT region_id, percentile, reallocation_days AS median_days
   from percent_cte
	where percentile > 50
    group by region_id 
    
    
What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?
	SELECT txn_type,COUNT(1) AS transaction_count, SUM(txn_amount)
	from data_bank.customer_transactions
	group by txn_type;
		
		
What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?
	SELECT COUNT(customer_id)/(select count(distinct customer_id) from data_bank.customer_transactions) AS transaction_count, avg(txn_amount)
	from data_bank.customer_transactions
	where txn_type = 'deposit';



For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?
	SELECT (select count(distinct customer_id) from data_bank.customer_transactions where txn_type = 'deposit') AS transaction_count_deposit, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
from data_bank.customer_transactions
where transaction_count_deposit > 1 and 
group by month(txn_date)



What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?
What is the percentage of customers who increase their closing balance by more than 5%?
